## Project Description

Predicting churn is a very common, important and challenging task for companies which business model relies on products with a subscription model. It minimizes customer defection by predicting which customers are likely to cancel a subscription to a service and take actions in order to prevent it.
In this capstone project, Udacity provided a 12 GB dataset of fictitious user interactions with a music streaming company called Sparkify. Whether the user listens to a song, adds it to a playlist or pushes the thumbs up button, all the user activities are logged and can be used for churn prediction.Â 
The development process for Sparkify churn prediction is divided into three steps:
Exploratory data analysis.
Feature engineering.
Modelling and evaluation.
